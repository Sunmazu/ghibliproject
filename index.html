        <p>Welcome, I would like to introduce to you, </br>
        one of the best anime movie studios "Studio Ghibli" that made movies like:</p>
        <p>- "My neighbor Totoro"</br>
        - "Princess Mononoke"</br>
        - "Spirited Away"</br>
        - "Howl's Moving Castle"</br></br>
        and much, much more </br></br></p>

        <p>In my opinion this studio is the eastern equivalent of Disney</br>
        When in disney:</p>
        <p>- Every character have a dream,</br>
        - They sing about what they need,</br>
        - You can see who is good and evil,</br>
        - there is always a happy ending.</br>
        </p></br>

        <p>Studio Ghibli shows that there is something more than what you want:</p>
        <p>-there is no songs singed by characters, </br>
        - It's hard to tell if the ending is happy or no, </br>
        - sometimes you can't even differ betwen good and evil,</br>
        - You yourself can decide which and how you will understand wisdom shown in the movie.</p>
