            <p>"Spirited Away" / "Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi"</p>
            <p>~ It propably is the best animated movie of all times ~</p>

            <p>When it comes to "Spirited Away" I would actually like to say that in my opinion it is the best,
                the scenes, the story, the plot, everything sums up for great story and is cute, you can tear up a bit.
            </p>

            <p>Synopsis:</br>
                Stubborn, spoiled, and naïve, 10-year-old Chihiro Ogino is less than pleased when she and her parents
                discover an abandoned amusement
                park on the way to their new house. Cautiously venturing inside, she realizes that there is more to this
                place than meets the eye,
                as strange things begin to happen once dusk falls. Ghostly apparitions and food that turns her parents
                into pigs are just the start—Chihiro has unwittingly
                crossed over into the spirit world. Now trapped, she must summon the courage to live and work amongst
                spirits, with the help of the enigmatic
                Haku and the cast of unique characters she meets along the way.</br></br>

                Vivid and intriguing, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi tells the story of Chihiro's journey through an
                unfamiliar world as she strives to save her parents and return home.
            </p> </br></br>
