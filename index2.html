            <p>"My neighbor totoro" / "Tonari no Totoro"</p>
            <p>~ this movie is the face of studio ghibli,
                even in their store their logo is shown in form of totoro
                which is a very pleasant surprise ~</p>

            <p>To begin with, first time when I saw it I was mesmerised
                by sketch animations that studio ghibli performed in this
                and every other movie, I love the characters, the story, overall
                feels that are shooting right at your heart when you think you
                won't feel emotional and cry sometimes
            </p>

            <p>Synopsis:</br>
                In 1950s Japan, Tatsuo Kusakabe relocates himself and his two daughters, Satsuki and Mei,
                to the countryside to be closer to their mother, who is hospitalized due to long-term illness.
                As the girls grow acquainted with rural life, Mei encounters a small, bunny-like creature in the yard
                one day.
                Chasing it into the forest, she finds "Totoro"â€”a giant, mystical forest spirit whom she soon befriends.
                Before long, Satsuki too meets Totoro, and the two girls suddenly find their lives filled with magical
                adventures in nature and fantastical creatures of the woods.
            </p> </br></br>

            <p>I highly recomend it to you and people around you ^_^ </p>
