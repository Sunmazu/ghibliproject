            <p>~ What's more to say, I LOVE THIS movie ~</p>

            <p>So, Princess mononoke is a beautifull and greatest among the greatest animated movies to this day. I love
                that every movie
                animated by "Hayao Miyazaki" have new styles
            </p>

            <p>Synopsis:</br>
                When an Emishi village is attacked by a fierce demon boar, the young prince Ashitaka puts his life at
                stake to defend his tribe.
                With its dying breath, the beast curses the prince's arm, granting him demonic powers while gradually
                siphoning his life away.
                Instructed by the village elders to travel westward for a cure, Ashitaka arrives at Tatara, the Iron
                Town,
                where he finds himself embroiled in a fierce conflict: Lady Eboshi of Tatara, promoting constant
                deforestation,
                stands against Princess San and the sacred spirits of the forest, who are furious at the destruction
                brought by the humans.
                As the opposing forces of nature and mankind begin to clash in a desperate struggle for survival,
                Ashitaka attempts to seek harmony between the two, all the while battling the latent demon inside of
                him.
                Princess Mononoke is a tale depicting the connection of technology and nature, while showing the path to
                harmony that could be achieved by mutual acceptance.
